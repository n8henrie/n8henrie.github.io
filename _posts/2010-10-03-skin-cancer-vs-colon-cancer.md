    Abstract
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Vitamin D sufficiency is required for optimal health, and solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance is an important source of vitamin D. UVB and/or vitamin D have been found in observational studies to be associated with reduced risk for over a dozen forms of cancer, multiple sclerosis, osteoporotic fractures, and several other diseases. On the other hand, excess UV irradiance is associated with adverse health outcomes such as cataracts, melanoma, and nonmelanoma skin cancer. Ecologic analyses are used to estimate the fraction of cancer mortality, multiple sclerosis prevalence, and cataract formation that can be prevented or delayed. Estimates from the literature are used for other diseases attributed to excess UV irradiation, additional cancer estimates, and osteoporotic fractures. These results are used to estimate the economic burdens of insufficient UVB irradiation and vitamin D insufficiency as well as excess UV irradiation in the United States for these diseases and conditions. <b>We estimate that 50,000-63,000 individuals in the United States and 19,000-25,000 in the UK die prematurely from cancer annually due to insufficient vitamin D. The U.S. economic burden due to vitamin D insufficiency from inadequate exposure to solar UVB irradiance, diet, and supplements was estimated at $40-56 billion in 2004, whereas the economic burden for excess UV irradiance was estimated at $6-7 billion. These results suggest that increased vitamin D through UVB irradiance, fortification of food, and supplementation could reduce the health care burden in the United States, UK, and elsewhere. </b>Further research is required to confirm these estimates.

    Abstract
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance and/or vitamin D have been found inversely correlated with incidence, mortality, and/or survival rates for breast, colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancer and Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<b> Evidence is emerging that more than 17 different types of cancer are likely to be vitamin D-sensitive. A recent meta-analysis concluded that 1,000 IU of oral vitamin D per day is associated with a 50% reduction in colorectal cancer incidence. </b>Using this value, as well as the findings in a multifactorial ecologic study of cancer mortality rates in the US, estimates for reductions in risk of vitamin D-sensitive cancer mortality rates were made for 1,000 IU/day. These estimates, along with annual average serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, were used to estimate the reduction in cancer mortality rates in several Western European and North American countries that would result from intake of 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D.<b> It was estimated that reductions could be 7% for males and 9% for females in the US and 14% for males and 20% for females in Western European countries below 59 degrees.</b> It is proposed that increased fortification of food and increased availability of supplements could help increase vitamin D intake and could augment small increases in production of vitamin D from solar UVB irradiance. <b>Providing 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day for all adult Americans would cost about $1 billion; the expected benefits for cancer would be in the range of $16-25 billion in addition to other health benefits of vitamin D.</b>

    Abstract
  </div>
  
  <div>
    BACKGROUND: Inadequate photosynthesis or oral intake of Vitamin D are associated with high incidence rates of colorectal cancer, but the dose-response relationship has not been adequately studied. METHODS: Dose-response gradients from observational studies of Vitamin D intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were plotted as trend lines. The point on each linear trend line corresponding to an odds ratio of 0.50 provided the prediagnostic Vitamin D intake or 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration associated with 50% lower risk compared to <100IU/day Vitamin D or <13ng/ml serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Medians of these values were determined. <b>RESULTS: Overall, individuals with >or=1000IU/day oral Vitamin D (p<0.0001) or >or=33ng/ml (82nmol/l) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (p<0.01) had 50% lower incidence of colorectal cancer compared to reference values. CONCLUSIONS: Intake of 1000IU/day of Vitamin D, half the safe upper intake established by the National Academy of Sciences, was associated with 50% lower risk. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 33ng/ml, which is known to be safe, also was associated with 50% lower risk. Prompt public health action is needed to increase intake of Vitamin D(3) to 1000IU/day, and to raise 25-hydroxyvitamin D by encouraging a modest duration of sunlight exposure.</b>

  <div>
    Solar radiation is both the main cause of all types of skin cancer, including
  </div>
  
  <div>
    cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), and the main source of vitamin D accompanied 
  </div>
  
  <div>
    by its beneficial effects. The dilemma lies in that increased sun exposure could 
  </div>
  
  <div>
    lead to an increase in skin cancers and yet is necessary for the better prognosis
  </div>
  
  <div>
    of internal cancers. Solar radiation varies in intensity and spectral composition
  </div>
  
  <div>
    with geographic location and time. Of central interest in the present context is 
  </div>
  
  <div>
    that the UVA/UVB ratio can vary. Thus, the UVA/UVB ratio increases with
  </div>
  
  <div>
    decreasing solar elevation. The ratio is also larger for most sun beds than that 
  </div>
  
  <div>
    in the midday sun, but similar to that in the afternoon sun. This may have large 
  </div>
  
  <div>
    health implications, since vitamin D is exclusively generated by UVB, while UVA
  </div>
  
  <div>
    and UVB likely play a role in the onset of CMM. <b>Sun and sun beds act similarly:</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>one quantum of radiation at a given wavelength has the same biological effect,</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>irrespective of the source from which it comes. The winter levels of vitamin D</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>are 10 to 100% lower than the summer levels in most populations, but can be</b>

  <div>
    <b>brought up to summer levels by moderate sun bed exposure.</b> Doses of 200 IU of

    Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide health problem. The major source of vitamin D
  </div>
  
  <div>
    for most humans is sensible sun exposure. Factors that influence cutaneous
  </div>
  
  <div>
    vitamin D production include sunscreen use, skin pigmentation, time of day,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    season of the year, latitude, and aging. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is
  </div>
  
  <div>
    the measure for vitamin D status. A total of 100 IU of vitamin D raises blood
  </div>
  
  <div>
    level of 25(OH)D by 1 ng/ml. Thus, children and adults who do not receive
  </div>
  
  <div>
    adequate vitamin D from sun exposure need at least 1000 IU/d vitamin D. Lack of
  </div>
  
  <div>
    sun exposure and vitamin D deficiency have been linked to many serious chronic
  </div>
  
  <div>
    diseases, including autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, cardiovascular
  </div>
  
  <div>
    disease, and deadly cancers. <b>It is estimated that there is a 30 to 50% reduction </b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>in risk for developing colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer by either</b>

    Interest in vitamin D has extended to examinations of its influence on
  </div>
  
  <div>
    premalignant conditions such as adenomatous polyps and breast density. Studies of
  </div>

    BACKGROUND: Melanoma incidence and survival are positively associated, both
  </div>
  
  <div>
    geographically and temporally. <b>Solar elastosis, a histologic indicator of</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>cutaneous sun damage, has also been positively associated with melanoma survival.</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Although these observations raise the possibility that sun exposure increases
  </div>
  
  <div>
    melanoma survival, they could be explained by an association between incidence
  </div>
  
  <div>
    and early detection of melanoma. We therefore evaluated the association between
  </div>
  
  <div>
    measures of skin screening and death from cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: Case
  </div>
  
  <div>
    subjects (n = 528) from a population-based study of cutaneous melanoma were
  </div>
  
  <div>
    followed for an average of more than 5 years. Data, including measures of
  </div>
  
  <div>
    intermittent sun exposure, perceived awareness of the skin, skin self-screening, 
  </div>
  
  <div>
    and physician screening, were collected during in-person interviews and review of
  </div>
  
  <div>
    histopathology and histologic parameters (i.e., solar elastosis, Breslow
  </div>
  
  <div>
    thickness, and mitoses) for all of the lesions. Competing risk models were used
  </div>
  
  <div>
    to compute risk of death (hazard ratios [HRs], with 95% confidence intervals

  <div>

    BACKGROUND: Cutaneous malignant melanoma is the most serious form of skin cancer 
  </div>
  
  <div>
    and accounts for about three-quarters of all skin cancer deaths. Over the last
  </div>
  
  <div>
    few decades the incidence and mortality rates of melanoma have been increasing
  </div>
  
  <div>
    worldwide. The risk of melanoma is higher in individuals with both phenotypic
  </div>
  
  <div>
    susceptibility and a history of sun exposure. Therefore, recommended sun
  </div>
  
  <div>
    protection behaviours include wearing long-sleeved clothing, seeking shade,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    avoiding the sun when it is strongest, and using sunscreen lotion with a sun
  </div>
  
  <div>
    protection factor of 15 or higher. It has been reported, however, that the use of
  </div>
  
  <div>
    sunscreens does not protect against melanoma and seems to increase the duration
  </div>
  
  <div>
    of recreational sun exposure. METHODS: Published epidemiological studies
  </div>
  
  <div>
    examining sunscreen use and melanoma have been reviewed from an epidemiological
  </div>
  
  <div>
    point of view, taking into account potential biases. We have classified
  </div>
  
  <div>
    case-control studies into four categories: (1) inconclusive studies because of
  </div>
  
  <div>
    major bias in control population and/or the lack of multivariate analysis; (2) no
  </div>
  
  <div>
    association between sunscreen use and melanoma after controlling for confounders;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    (3) negative association (i.e. protective effect of sunscreen); and (4) positive 
  </div>
  
  <div>
    association. Various other epidemiological studies were also analysed. <b>RESULTS:</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>These results are controversial. Two case-control studies show a protective</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>effect of sunscreen use, while three studies showed a significant risk associated</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>with sunscreen use.</b> However, the discordant results, the low relative risks, the 
  </div>
  
  <div>
    lack of dose-effect relationship and the numerous biases, especially the
  </div>
  
  <div>
    uncertainty that exposure (sunscreen use) preceded melanoma do not suggest a
  </div>
  
  <div>
    causative association between sunscreen use and melanoma. Several hypotheses
  </div>
  
  <div>
    could partly explain these contradictory results.

    healthy controls were interviewed in Germany, France and Belgium. The
  </div>
  
  <div>
    questionnaire used differentiated between regular sunscreens, psoralen sunscreen 
  </div>
  
  <div>
    (prepared with 5-methoxypsoralen, a tanning activator and photocarcinogen), and
  </div>
  
  <div>
    self-tanning cosmetics (which produce a tan without ultraviolet radiation). After
  </div>
  
  <div>
    adjusting for age, sex, hair colour and holiday weeks spent each year in sunny
  </div>
  
  <div>
    resorts, the melanoma risk was of 1.50 (95% Cl:1.09-2.06) for regular sunscreens,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    and of 2.28 (95% Cl: 1.28-4.04) for psoralen sunscreens. No melanoma risk was
  </div>
  
  <div>
    associated with use of self-tanning cosmetics. Among subjects with a poor ability
  </div>
  
  <div>
    to tan, psoralen sunscreen users displayed a melanoma risk of 4.45 (95% Cl:
  </div>
  
  <div>
    1.25-15.8) when compared with regular sunscreen users. There was a significant
  </div>

    adulthood. <b>Use of sunscreens, especially psoralen sunscreen, was associated with </b>

    Abstract
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Intermittent sun exposure and sunburn are strong predictors of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). On the other hand, melanomas may arise also in non-sun-exposed areas such as the vulva. However, little is known about a possible relationship between sun exposure and vulvar melanoma. Temporal and latitudinal dependencies of the incidence rates of vulvar melanoma were studied in comparison with those of CMM among Caucasians in Sweden, East Germany, USA and Victoria (Australia). The ratios of vulvar melanoma incidence rates to those of CMM tend to decrease with increasing CMM rates. The incidence rates of CMM have increased with time until recently, while those of vulvar melanoma have either decreased or remain constant. In USA vulvar melanoma incidence rates seem to increase from south to north, while for CMM incidence rates on sun exposed skin areas decrease from south to north. Comparison of latitudinal trends of the incidence rates of vulvar melanomas and CMM show opposite trends. Whenever CMM rates increase, either with time or with decreasing latitude (indicating increased sun exposure) the ratio of vulvar melanoma rates to CMM rates on exposed skin, seem to decrease. <b>Thus, latitudinal trends seem to support the assumption that vulvar melanomas are not generated by UV radiation, and the possibility exists that solar UV radiation, probably via its role in vitamin D photosynthesis in exposed skin, may have a protective effect against vulvar melanoma and should be further investigated. </b>Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.
