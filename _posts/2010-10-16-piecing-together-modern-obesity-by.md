    Matt discovered a really cool tool for non-linear presentations called Prezi.  Students can get a decent (free) account by signing up with their .edu address.

    The presentation is best viewed in full screen mode.  I had some problems viewing fullscreen in the embedded version below, so I included the link above which may work better.

    Use your left and right arrow buttons (keyboard or on-screen) to navigate through the presentation as I&#8217;ve set it up, but also feel free to use the zoom tool and your mouse to move around the presentation freely and take a closer look at personal notes that I didn&#8217;t highlight in the presentation.

    Was actually pretty fun to make.  Props to Matt for the find.
