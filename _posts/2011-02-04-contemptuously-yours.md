    Dear everyone that repeatedly formats status updates as if you were addressing an entity with whom you are unable to actually communicate, 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This meme is so cliché it&#8217;s like beating a dead horse.  If you have something you want to say, I encourage you to simply say it.  Preferably in a way that isn&#8217;t excruciatingly trite.  Very little could be as banal as your concluding &#8220;Love, [Your Name].&#8221;  Please be more creative in the future.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Love,<br />Nate
