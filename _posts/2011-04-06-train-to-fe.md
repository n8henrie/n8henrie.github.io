    For one of Megan&#8217;s Bday gifts, I decided to treat her to a day trip to Santa Fe. We decided to take the train as part of the adventure.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We ended up getting some great pizza with a nice balcony view of the plaza, did some great people-watching, had some ice cream, saw some art and the Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe museum, had some ice cream, and took a nap in the grass.
  </p>

    After the train back she bought me an incredible dinner at the most expensive restaurant in the world (or close to it, I&#8217;m pretty sure). It was delicious! Duck, buffalo, pork, lamb, and ahi tuna&#8230; And crème brûlée too! Yum. Great day.
