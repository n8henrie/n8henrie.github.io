  When I'm texting, I'll frequently whisper the text to myself before I send it. Â In theory, this helps me minimize the errors that are so common in translating face-to-face communication to asynchronous text-based communication, which lack facial expression, gesticulation, modulation of cadence and pitch, etc. In the end, though, I think I just end up looking like the crazy guy that's whispering to himself while his fingers peck furiously at his computer / phone. :S
