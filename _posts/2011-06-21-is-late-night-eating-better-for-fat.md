        </p>
        
        <p>
          It&#8217;s commonly believed that it&#8217;s better to eat more earlier in the day and less later in the day; eating late can supposedly interfere with fat loss and/or cause unwanted weight gain. In a nutshell, this myth is summed up by the saying that you should &#8220;eat breakfast like a king, lunch a queen, dinner like a pauper.&#8221;<br />You will often find proponents of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=broscience" target="_blank">broscience</a> clinging to the notion that carbs somehow become more fattening after 6 P.M. This is nonsense of course.

            You might already know that this is BS, as I debunked the late night eating myth in <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2010/10/top-ten-fasting-myths-debunked.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Top Ten Fasting Myths Debunked&#8221;</a> (Myth 10). In <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2010/10/top-ten-fasting-myths-debunked.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Top Ten Fasting Myths Debunked&#8221;</a> I concluded that there was no scientific evidence in support of the late night eating myth or the notion that we should eat more earlier in the day.<br />But the facts are actually more interesting than what I&#8217;ve previously stated; in controlled studies, late eating patterns are <b>superior</b> for fat loss and body composition.<br />In this article, I&#8217;ll review studies on temporal distribution of calorie intake and summarize the results. I will devote a bit of extra attention to the latest study, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21475137" target="_blank">&#8220;Greater Weight Loss and Hormonal Changes After 6 Months Diet With Carbohydrates Eaten Mostly at Dinner&#8221;</a>, which is what caused me to revisit this topic in the first place.<br />One pressing question first: Why is the late night eating myth still around if there are studies showing the exact opposite..?
          </p>

            <span style="color: orange; font-size: large;"><b><span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: normal;"><b>Late Night Eating in Dietary Epidemiology</b></span></b></span><br /> <span style="color: orange; font-size: large;"><b><span style="color: #ff6600; font-weight: normal;"><b><br /> </b></span></b></span><br /> Someone asked this in comments:<br />&#8220;Is it ok to eat dinner 1-2h before bedtime? Note that every damn meat eating mammal goes to sleep after consuming massive amounts of food e.g lions, dogs, bears but apparently somewhere down the line, nutritionist´s came up with the conclusion that we somehow evolved. So it would be nice if someone came with some evidence that you shouldn´t eat before bed. I really don&#8217;t understand why not, could you please explain?&#8221;
          </p>
          
          <div>
            Yes, how did nutritionists arrive at the conclusion that eating before bedtime is bad for you?<br />The late night eating myth is mainly another consequence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation" target="_blank">mistaking correlation for causation</a> in dietary epidemiology. There are plenty of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21527892" target="_blank">observational studies </a>that have found a positive association between calories consumed in the evening and a higher BMI in the general population.<br />This association is solely attributed to the fact that Average Joe&#8217;s who like to eat more in the evening also consume more calories overall. <a href="https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=blogger&passive=1209600&continue=http://www.blogger.com/home&followup=http://www.blogger.com/home&ltmpl=start">In this study</a>, it was deducted from food logs that late eaters consumed on average 248 calories more than the other group.<br />Similar relationships are commonly found in other observational studies on meal patterns. People who skip breakfast, skip meals and eat late at night are on average fatter and worse off than people who eat breakfast, regular meals and eat less in the evening. This has nothing to do with meal timing per se, but the lifestyle that goes in hand with &#8220;dysregulated&#8221; eating habits (as discussed in <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2010/10/top-ten-fasting-myths-debunked.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Top Ten Fasting Myths Debunked&#8221;</a>).<br />

              Meal pattern with omission of breakfast or breakfast and lunch was related to a clustering of less healthy lifestyle factors and food choice leading to a poorer nutrient intake. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14647222" target="_blank">(Ref.)</a></p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
              Late night eating is not only correlated to a higher calorie intake, but also less sleep time and more sedentary activities, i.e. watching TV and more time spent in front of the computer, which are additional confounders that can predispose people to weight gain.

Shift-workers are predisposed to a myriad of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21537197" target="_blank">health disorders</a>; obesity, poor mental health, cardiovascular disease, peptic ulcers and gastrointestinal problems (likely a result of chronic stress).<br />The negative effects of shift-work on health is mainly the result of a compromised diet, sleep deprivation, and stress &#8211; these tend to go hand. However, it&#8217;s possible that feeding under conditions of a disrupted circadian rhythm and an irregular meal pattern is an independent factor in the predisposition towards poor health amongst shift-workers.<br />Humans can <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20100529" target="_blank">adapt</a> to a wide variety of feeding regimens depending on the habitual meal pattern. This <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2009/08/ghrelin-and-entrained-meal-patterns.html" target="_blank">entrainment</a> takes place on a cellular level and is regulated by ghrelin, a hormone that increases during meal times and prepare your metabolism to best handle a nutrient load. Similarly, the circadian rhythm &#8211; when you awake and go to sleep &#8211; is regulated by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17022876" target="_blank">daylight</a> and habitual sleep/wake-cycle, and adapts your metabolism accordingly.<br />Simply put, your body expects a certain routine every day, depending on habitual diet patterns and sleep/wake cycles, and adjusts its hormonal profile and metabolism accordingly. If this pattern is haphazardly and constantly shifted back and forth, and never allowed to adapt, as is the case with many shift-workers &#8211; it&#8217;s very possible that it would be an independent factor in predisposing people to disease and health disorders. The<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21350389" target="_blank"> hormonal profile</a> of shift-workers tend to be less favorable than non-shift workers, for example.<br />It should be noted that permanent shift-workers, i.e. those who always work nights, or work nights on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16887753" target="_blank">consecutive days</a>, are better off than other shift workers, which is partly be explained by re-entraining the circadian rhythm; it seems that an &#8220;unpredictable&#8221; pattern, i.e. rotating day and night-shifts is the main culprit, as the circadian rhythm is constantly desynchronized. However, given the many confounders present amongst shift-workers, i.e. stress, sleep loss, calorie intake, it&#8217;s hard to isolate which factor does what, i.e. is feeding during biological night worse than sleep deprivation, etc.

            <p>
              The aforementioned studies are of no interest to us. We are interested in <b>controlled studies</b>, not dietary epidemiology and observations in the general population. If you use dietary epidemiology to tell people how they should be eating you get this: <a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/" target="_blank">The USDA Dinner Plate</a>. When you use controlled studies to draw a conclusion, you get something that looks a little bit<a href="http://www.comfortmewithoffal.com/post/6119447875/there-that-looks-better" target="_blank"> more like this</a>. Throw some veggies in there and you&#8217;re all set.

              Controlled studies answers questions like &#8220;I&#8217;m on a 2000 calorie diet. How will fat loss be impacted if I eat most of those calories in the later part of the day versus the earlier part of the day?&#8221; <i>That&#8217;s</i> what interesting to us, so let&#8217;s look into this now.</p>

              </p>
              
              <p>
                In all of these studies, calories were controlled and fixed for all groups. The only variable that differed was the temporal daily distribution of calorie intake. In late meal patterns, 67-100% of total daily caloric intake was eaten between 6 PM and bed time, and this was compared against an early meal pattern with an opposite pattern.<br />Starting with the earliest study and working myself down to the latest study, I&#8217;ll briefly summarize the results, comment on the validity of the study, and interject whatever else of interest I find in each study.<br />Note that I will not include studies on Ramadan fasting. In loosely controlled studies on Ramadan fasting, fat loss and improvements in health markers is commonly found. This is a paradoxical and interesting finding, simply for the fact that people eat in the middle of the night, shortly before bedtime, along with a concomitant increase in intake of sugary treats and baked goods (and sometimes total calorie intake). However, these are rarely calorie-controlled studies, i.e. participants do not have strict guidelines about what they should eat, which is why I will not include them in this review.

Aside from lipid oxidation, there were no differences in cortisol levels, blood pressure or resting energy expenditure between the groups.

Interestingly, fat loss was greatest among ex-breakfast eaters who followed the breakfast skipping diet. This group ate lunch and supper and consumed 2/3 of their daily calorie intake at supper (6 PM or later).

                      In contrast, baseline breakfast skippers who were put on a breakfast diet got more favorable results than those who continued the breakfast skipping pattern. The implication of these seemingly paradoxical findings might be related to impulse-control; dysregulated eating habits, such as breakfast skipping, tend to go hand in hand with uninhibited and impulsive eating. Eating breakfast might therefore be of benefit for those with poor self-control, such as the ex-breakfast skippers in this study.

                      On the other hand, more favorable results were had with breakfast skipping amongst the &#8220;controlled&#8221; eaters (habitual breakfast eaters). This group would be more representative of us, meaning people who are used to count calories, follow an organized diet and not just mindlessly eat whatever is in front of us.

                                Certain endocrine influences might have contributed to the difference in fat-free mass change between the meal patterns. Growth hormone secretion displays an endogenous rhythm that is partially linked with the sleep cycle. At night pulsatile secretion increases after 1-2 hours of sleep, with maximal secretion occurring during stages 3 and 4 of sleep.</p>

                                  Although the effect of prolonged changes in dietary intake or meal patterns on growth hormone release are not known, it is conceivable that a greater flux of dietary amino acids with the large evening meals, coupled with the known protein anabolic effect of growth hormone, might combine to favor deposition of lean tissue.

                                                          But what I found most interesting, at least for those of us who want to <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2010/03/maintaining-low-body-fat.html" target="_blank">maintain low body fat</a>, was that the carb-rich dinner increased <i>average</i> leptin levels compared to the standard diet:<br />

                                                            Our experimental diet might manipulate daily leptin secretion, leading to higher relative concentrations throughout the day. We propose that this modification of hormone secretion helped participants experience greater satiety during waking hours, enhance diet maintenance over time and have better anthropometric outcomes.</p>

                                                            Perhaps this is why me, and many others with me, have found Leangains/intermittent fasting to be such an easy way of staying lean <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2010/03/secret-benefit-of-being-lean.html" target="_blank">once you&#8217;ve reached your goals</a>.<br />This study was solid, but for some reason there was no mention of how body fat percentage was measured. Similarly, calorie intake was not set individually and according to energy needs. However, given that everyone had the same job (police officer), it&#8217;s fair to assume that physical activity did not vary much on an individual basis. Furthermore, sample size was very large (78 participants), which makes it unlikely that the results were confounded by these factors.

                                                            Dietary epidemiology commonly find associations between certain meal patterns and higher BMI / body fatness. However, this association can solely be attributed to lifestyle-related factors and eating behaviors; snacking in front of the TV in the evening, making poor food choices in general, and so forth. People who eat more in the evening simply eat more calories, which explains why they weigh more.
                                                          </p>
                                                          
                                                          <p>
                                                            Calorie-controlled studies looking at the effects of distributing a fixed caloric load differently throughout the day are scarce; I have listed all of them above. These tell a much different story than the one found in dietary epidemiology. While short-term studies (15-18 days) do not find a statistically significant difference between early and late meal patterns, long-term studies (>12 weeks) show that late eating patterns produce superior results on fat loss, body composition and/or diet adherence. This might be explained by more favorable nutrient partitioning after meals due to hormonal modulation.<br />I understand that these facts might be hard to swallow for some people, given everything we&#8217;ve heard about late night eating being bad, fattening, and so forth. But then again, we hear a lot of strange things in the fitness and health community. Rarely do these old wives&#8217; tales mix with reality; think of all the <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2010/10/top-ten-fasting-myths-debunked.html" target="_blank">myths about fasting</a>, <a href="http://www.leangains.com/2010/07/truth-about-alcohol-fat-loss-and-muscle.html" target="_blank">alcohol</a> and<a href="http://www.leangains.com/search/label/MealFrequency" target="_blank"> meal frequency</a>, for example.<br />That&#8217;s all for tonight. I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed the article and will rest easy knowing there&#8217;s nothing bad about late night eating and <a href="http://www.leangains.com/search/label/LeangainsMeals" target="_blank">big meals</a> before bedtime.<br /><b>P.S.</b> I have a bunch of extra text that I could not fit in anywhere without straying off topic or making this piece too long. However, I might add part of it in an extra section within the next few days. It will be at the end of the article (in/after &#8220;Summary&#8221;). Stay tuned if that sounds interesting.
