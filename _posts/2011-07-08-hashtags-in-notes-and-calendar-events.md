**Update Oct 09, 2012:** _In contrast to previous versions of iCal, the search function on OSX 10.8's Calendar.app seems to be appropriately differentiating between "hashtag" and "#hashtag." Nice! —n8henrie Tue Oct 9 17:41:13 MDT 2012_

    A while back, I started using hashtags in the titles of my Google calendar / iCal events (frequently created with <a href="http://quickcalapp.com">QuickCal</a>, which I highly recommend).  I use the same thing with <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com">Simplenote</a> / <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>.  
  </div>

    The idea behind this is that I can use the apps' search functions to get a list of events related to a given project or topic.  For better or worse, the hashtag doesn't seem to make a difference on the search results in Google Calendar or iCal (IIRC — I need to double check iCal).  It <i>does</i>, however, make a different in spotlight searching on iOS.  Compare these screenshots.  One shows me all of my calendar events that I've marked as relevant to my Ob/Gyn rotation, the other shows me all kinds of stuff that happens to have the letters Ob.

    The difference is even more important in Simplenote / Notational Velocity, where "#temp" efficiently pulls up all of my temporary notes, as compared to "temp", which would give me every note that contained the word template, temporary, temper, contempt, etc.

    Make sense?
