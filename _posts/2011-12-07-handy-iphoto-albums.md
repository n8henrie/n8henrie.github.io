I made a few new iPhoto albums today that I&#8217;m pretty excited about, don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t think of it before.  Finally puts to use all the work I&#8217;ve put in to maintain a decently organized iPhoto library.  Every few months I go through my recent photos, and I try to at least: 

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      give my favorite shots a rating (4 or 5 stars)
    </li>
    <li>
      flag photos I want to eventually print for the posters I hang in my room
    </li>
    <li>
      tag the faces of major characters using iPhoto&#8217;s Faces feature
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    Below I&#8217;m going to quickly go through the handiest iPhoto albums I&#8217;ve made so far.
  </div>

<span style="font-size: large;"><u>Faces</u></span> 

<div>
  This is mostly for the convenient features that Apple has built into the way iPhoto interfaces with other Apple devices.  I use it all the time to show people who my roommate or girlfriend is.  Just make sure that you go through and confirm the faces in iPhoto (which may take a while, esp since Faces is nowhere near as good as Google / Picasa&#8217;s face detection algorithm).  To sync to other devices, go into iTunes and hit the checkbox in the &#8220;Photos&#8221; tab under &#8220;Faces&#8221; (pretty intuitive, right).  One tip I might include is that you can only select certain people&#8217;s &#8220;Faces&#8221; to sync to your mobile device.  That way, if you&#8217;ve been diligent and have hundreds of &#8220;Faces&#8221; albums, you can just check off a few that you might find useful (yourself, SO, roomie, family), and that way you shouldn&#8217;t have to sort through all the rest every time.

<u><span style="font-size: large;">Favorites</span></u> 

<div>
  Taking the next step, iPhoto&#8217;s &#8220;Smart Albums&#8221; can be <i>really</i> helpful and powerful.  For example, I have a &#8220;Favorites&#8221; album that automatically includes any photo that has been rated 4 or 5 stars.  This one might have been automatically included in iPhoto, I don&#8217;t remember.  Either way, it&#8217;s super simple to create a smart album and set it to
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      include photos rated in the range of 4 to 5 stars
    </li>
    <li>
      exclude videos (&#8220;photo is not movie&#8221; or something like that)
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  I use my Favorites smart album as my Apple TV screensaver, and it&#8217;s been great to have.  Sometimes I&#8217;ll sit in the living room and chat with friends for hours about the pics that come across the screen.  Also nice since I can stream background music through the ATV simultaneously.
</div>

<div>
  <u><span style="font-size: large;">Profile Pics</span></u><br />I was just inspired to make this one today.  The reason is that I like to put profile pics on the apps I use that have the option&#8230; but I hardly ever feel like snapping a new pic of myself right then and there, and it&#8217;s a pain to go scrolling through my whole library to try and find a good pic.  So this album is just a regular album (not a &#8220;smart album&#8221;), but I populated it by making a temporary smart album with the criteria
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Face is [your name]
    </li>
    <li>
      Rating is 4-5 stars
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  That gave me an album with nothing but good pictures that I was in.  Then I took the ones that looked like they&#8217;d make good profile pictures and drag-and-dropped them into my new &#8220;Profile Pics&#8221; album.  Then make sure to select this album for syncing in iTunes, and <i>voila</i> &#8212; next time you want to set a profile picture on an iPhone app, you can almost always &#8220;choose existing,&#8221; and go right to your &#8220;Profile Pics&#8221; folder.
</div>

<u><span style="font-size: large;">S.O.</span></u> 

<div>
  A &#8220;best of&#8221; album, just for the cute factor:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Face is [your name]
    </li>
    <li>
      Face is [your SO&#8217;s name]
    </li>
    <li>
      Rating is 4-5 stars
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    Next time someone wants to see a pic of the SO, this makes it easy to pull up your favorite couples shot.  Don&#8217;t forget to hit the iTunes checkbox to sync it to your mobile devices!

  I also have smart albums for &#8220;phone pics&#8221; and &#8220;videos&#8221; &#8212; don&#8217;t really use them much, though.  Anybody else have any handy iPhoto albums?
