#### I’ve been looking for this for a while!

Chrome’s Omnibox is fantastic for a number of reasons, but sometimes it’s _too_ helpful. For example, I recently moved my blog from n8henrie.posterous.com to my own domain n8henrie.com. But every time I want to check my page, I start typing n8henrie.com and Chrome autofills n8henrie.posterous.com. Very annoying, since normally I could just type a few characters and hit “enter” (it would autocomplete the rest correctly).

I’ve run into this problem a number of times with different sites, or for example when I’d like to go to one of my bookmarks (which the Omnibox conveniently indexes), but I have a bunch of sites that pop up instead.
  


#### The solution:

  1. Start typing the URL in the Omnibar
  2. Use the up and down arrows to highlight the suggestion you’d like to get rid of
  3. On Mac, use the fn key (bottom left on my MBP) + shift + delete (I think shift + backspace on PC should work)

The site should disappear. Now I can just type “n8” in the Omnibox and n8henrie.com pops up. Nice!
