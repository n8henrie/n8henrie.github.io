If you have a paid Prime membership (the free student ones don&#8217;t work, the $39 student ones will), you can borrow one book per month for free from the Kindle Lending Library. 

I&#8217;ve identified a couple catches.  This only works if you have a Kindle (the Kindle apps for iOS / Mac / etc. won&#8217;t work as far as I know).  Also, Amazon has made it a little difficult to browse the books that are available for free.  However, I found a post describing a workaround for the second problem.  Seems to work great.

  1. Go to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">www.amazon.com</a> .
  2. Select &#8220;Books&#8221; in the drop-down menu for the main search box.
  3. Leaving the search box empty, click on the &#8220;Go&#8221; button. 
  4. Click &#8220;Kindle Edition.&#8221;
  5. Scroll down on the left hand side and click the &#8220;Prime Eligible&#8221; filter.
  6. Pick a book and get reading.
