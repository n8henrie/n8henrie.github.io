**Bottom line:** I should make t-shirts of myself and give them to all my friends. <!--more-->

I went out for pizza with my ladyfriend and some of her new coworkers yesterday evening.  She had just finished a long day of orientation and was leaving directly from the hospital (/school/work), and she offered to swing by and pick me up since I live nearby.  I was still in scrubs (currently in my anesthesiology rotation), so I quickly threw on some jeans.  As I ruffled through my cupboard of a closet, I spotted the perfect shirt for the night.  An all-white shirt with a turquoise bird in flight across the lower left corner, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf7PPs4FL_M&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Look Mom No Hands</a>” across the bird.  The old band of one of my closest friends.

  Suddenly, a strike of genius: invite that friend.  The thought hadn’t even crossed my mind, but it was late enough that he might be home from the hospital (/school/work).  Five seconds later, <a href="http://www.n8henrie.com/2012/01/siri-set-my-alarm/">Siri</a> was getting him on the line.

  What impressed me about this sequence of events was the unlikely but fortuitous reminder: a t-shirt.  I and my hellaciously busy friends<i> </i>are stuck wearing scrubs throughout much of the day.  Often, if we get a chance to go out for an evening, it will be after a long day in scrubs, and we’ll want to change into something more befitting.  As we select a casual outfit for our casual evening, we’ll inevitably see reminders of people that we’d love to invite along and might not otherwise consider.

  I already have a perfect shirt idea for another friend.  I’m not sure what will be funnier — hanging out with a friend while wearing a t-shirt of them (“<a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&keywords=i%20love%20pete&tag=n8henriecom-20&linkCode=ur2&qid=1340850914&camp=1789&creative=390957&rh=kilovepeteiapparel" target="_blank">I ♡ Pete</a>” apparel comes to mind)… or handing out t-shirts of myself to my friends.

  It’s genius.  Maybe I’ll start a post series for ideas like this and tag them #GeniusIdeas. </p>
