**Bottom line:** Clever, easy way to set up <a title="Quicksilver" href="http://qsapp.com" target="_blank">Quicksilver</a> triggers for apps that can launch via URL scheme.

I had previously set up similar triggers with the Web Search Module plugin that used Google to search the app stores (using an &#8220;intitle&#8221; specifier to try to differentiate between iPhone / iPad / Mac apps). This is much cooler &#8212; searches in the &#8220;local&#8221; apps (in other words actually in iTunes or the Mac App Store app).

My only contribution here is that instead of using triggers (since I have nearly all my convenient keyboard shortcuts occupied, between Quicksilver, TextExpander, and app-specific keyboard shortcuts), I just added the encoded URLs to the Quicksilver catalog. They seem to be indexed appropriately and functioning. The only slight inconvenience compared to the Trigger setup is that they don&#8217;t automatically put the cursor in the 3rd pane.

Here&#8217;s the original post with the setup info:
