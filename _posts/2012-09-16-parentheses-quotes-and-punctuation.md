As I&#8217;ve previously noted, [I use a lot of parentheses in my writing](http://www.n8henrie.com/2012/01/parenthesis/ "(Parenthesis)"). It&#8217;s not uncommon for me to be hastily composing a post and realize that I&#8217;m about to end a parenthetical thought as well as its mother sentence. Assuming that the parenthetical thought is a grammatically complete sentence, how should one punctuate?

<!--more-->

I default to punctuating both inside and outside the parenthesis (this tends to look pretty tacky.). Jane Straus from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.grammarbook.com/">grammarbook.com</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/parens.asp" title="See Rule 3.">seems to think this is correct</a>. I&#8217;ll note that ending a parenthetical thought in an abbreviation looks pretty bad as well, but is almost certainly correct (something ending in a list including this, that, etc.).

Continuing with this predicament, what are we to do with parenthetical exclamation or interrogation (this looks ridiculous!)?

The Chicago Manual of Style offers some guidance <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Punctuation.html?old=Punctuation36.html">here</a>, bolded for emphasis.

> For some reason, questions about periods have dominated the Q&A mail lately. Why the sudden confusion? Why, after a lifetime (I trust) of never encountering two periods in a row, do readers suddenly think this might be a good idea? In any case, here are some answers: **Don’t ever put two periods in a row. Put one period at the end of a declarative sentence, even if it ends with an abbreviation or a URL.** (Questions and exclamations use question marks and exclamation points instead of a period, not in addition to one, even in quotations.) A sentence that stands alone within parentheses needs a period inside the parentheses with it. (Here’s an example.) A sentence in parentheses within another sentence does not take a period, because the period is reserved for the main sentence (questions and exclamations, however, must have their respective marks!). **An abbreviation that ends with a period must not be left hanging without it (in parentheses, e.g.), and a sentence containing a parenthesis must itself have terminal punctuation (are we almost done?). Finally, an abbreviation ending with a period that is immediately followed by a question mark or exclamation point requires both marks (Q.E.D.!).**

I think I&#8217;m actually _way_ more confused after reading that. A few other guidelines that come up in Google recommend never using the .). for parenthetical sentences-in-sentences, that the external period is sufficient in these cases.

Next up, what about quotes? Between n8henrie.com and the <a target="_blank" href="http://SMRT.posterous.com">SMRT Blog</a>, I write a lot of how-to posts, and in many of these I use quoted phrases to set apart an exact string of characters or words. Usernames, URLs, and Google queries are common examples.

In American English, punctuation at the end of a sentence comes _inside_ of a closing quote. Is it considered incorrect to place this punctuation outside of the quote if the quote is being used to set apart an exact phrase? For example,

> Set the server to &#8220;http://www.example.com&#8221;.

I wouldn&#8217;t want to put that period inside the quote and confuse people trying to follow my instructions, so I think it is _reasonable_ in these cases to place the punctuation outside of the quotes. However, I&#8217;d rather know if it were _correct_ in addition to reasonable, since I am occasionally writing these instructions in reports destined for VIPs in the school of medicine.

In this case, grammarbook again <a target="_blank" href="http://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/quotes.asp">suggests that what I&#8217;ve been doing is okay</a>, at least for question marks, semicolons, and a few others. The APA style guide <a href="http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html" title="APA Style" target="_blank">offers similar advice</a>, although neither specifically address the case of trying to communicate an exact phrase that also happens to be at the end of a sentence requiring a period.

The most common answers that I&#8217;m seeing on forums (fora?) is to simply rewrite or rearrange the sentence to avoid the problem entirely. I don&#8217;t like that answer, but it&#8217;s probably easier than&#8230; writing this post. 

Any fellow tech bloggers want to chime in with your approach?
