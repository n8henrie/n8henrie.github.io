**Bottom line:** In American English, the most correct and generally accepted pronunciation of Latin words ending in -ae appears to be the long ē sound, as in &#8220;tea&#8221; or &#8220;C**ae**sar salad.&#8221;

I had an anatomy professor at New Mexico State University that was absolutely _adamant_ that the terminal &#8220;ae&#8221; sound, as in &#8220;placentae,&#8221; should be pronounced with the long ē sound: &#8220;placentee.&#8221;  He _really_ harped on this, over and over, insisting that people pronouncing it with the diphthong (as in &#8220;say&#8221;) were outright wrong.  I grew accustomed to his recommended pronunciation, but over the course of medical school I&#8217;ve rarely heard it.  Instead, each professor, attending, resident, and student seems to have his or her own, uniquely awkward way of pronouncing words like &#8220;uvulae.&#8221;

Tonight, <a href="http://twitter.com/giggirock" target="_blank">my roommate</a> and I did a few minutes of investigation, and it seems like my old professor was correct for the most part.  For example, here is <a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/placenta?region=us&q=placentae" target="_blank">the Oxford Dictionary page for placentae</a>.  It seems that the &#8220;ee&#8221; sound is correct for the American English pronunciation, at least.  If you&#8217;re speaking Latin, you may go for the traditional pronunciation, something sounding more like &#8220;eye&#8221; (e.g. the <a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/uvula?region=us&q=uvulae" target="_blank">Oxford entry for uvulae</a>, which shows both). Not much support for the clumsy &#8220;hey&#8221; sound.

Here&#8217;s a great site with soundclips from the <a href="http://www.uncg.edu/cla/pronounce.html" target="_blank">UNC Greensboro Department of Classical Studies</a>, which suggests the traditional pronunciation for curriculum vitae (phonetically something like curriculum vee-tie), but clearly demonstrates the &#8220;Standard American pronunciation&#8221; of alumnae as the phonetic equivalent of &#8220;alum-knee.&#8221;

Along the way, we encountered a number of lively debates regarding the three plural forms of cactus, platypus, Greek vs Latin roots, and numerous examples of &#8220;placentas,&#8221; &#8220;cervixes,&#8221; and &#8220;appendixes&#8221; being just as correct as &#8220;placentae,&#8221; &#8220;cervices,&#8221; and &#8220;appendices.&#8221;  In other words (ha), there&#8217;s plenty of opinion to go around, and as a medical student or resident there will never be a shortage of people telling me I&#8217;m wrong, but it seems that my old anatomy professor was right.  In American English, no other pronunciation of -ae seems _more_ correct or widely accepted than the long ē.  Some reputable sources list it as the _preferred_ pronunciation.  Although I admit this could just be coincidental, my roomie came up with what seems to be an excellent example: C**ae**sar salad.

So next time you&#8217;re stumbling over &#8220;fimbriae&#8221; (<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fimbriae" target="_blank">pronunciation at Merriam-Webster</a>), remember: there&#8217;s no need for awkward diphthong slurs, just give it an &#8220;ee.&#8221;
