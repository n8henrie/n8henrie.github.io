For this one, I had my phone in my pocket and was hoping Siri would actually &#8220;say&#8221; the time (which she didn&#8217;t), but I still think this will be handy. &#8220;Remember&#8230;&#8221; (with OmniFocus integration) and &#8220;set a timer for&#8230;&#8221; are probably my top 2 Siri features, so quickly displaying the timer is nice.
