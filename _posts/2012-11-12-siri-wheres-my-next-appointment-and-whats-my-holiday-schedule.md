**Bottom line: **Siri is smart enough to connect a few dots in telling you details about your schedule.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that Siri could answer a few queries that required a bit more &#8220;thinking&#8221; than just looking up a direct answer. In one case, I wasn&#8217;t sure what I had schedule for Thanksgiving. I knew that I could ask Siri a query regarding my schedule on a specific date, such as &#8220;What&#8217;s my schedule for Wednesday?&#8221; or &#8220;What&#8217;s my schedule for November 11th?&#8221; but I couldn&#8217;t remember when Thanksgiving ways. I also suspected that Siri could answer a question like &#8220;When is Thanksgiving?&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t want to ask two separate questions when I didn&#8217;t really care what the date of Thanksgiving was. Taking the next logical step, I was pleased to find that asking Siri about my schedule on Thanksgiving was no problem – she seemed fully able to identify Thanksgiving and pull up my schedule for that day. I know this seems simple, but I was impressed at the multi-step processing, which seemed to be no problem at all.

In the other case, I wanted to know how to get to my next appointment, but I didn&#8217;t remember what I had named the event.. I know Siri can give me directions, I know she can figure out what my &#8220;next appointment&#8221; is, and I know that I had input the location into the Calendar.app event. Again, I was pleased to see that she could figure out how to process a multi-step query like &#8220;How do I get to my next event?&#8221; in which she had to first decide what my next event was, then reference that for the event location, then present me with an address (and 1-click access to a turn-by-turn map).

Although I confess that [Siri and I have not always been the best of friends](http://www.n8henrie.com/2012/01/siri-set-my-alarm/), the way these two examples worked intuitively and on my first attempt certainly put a smile on my face.
