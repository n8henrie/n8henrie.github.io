**Bottom Line:** Make sure that iOS6 Maps actually takes you to the pin, and not just nearby.
  
<!--more-->

Despite all the ruckus, I _really_ like iOS6 Maps. I think it's a tremendous upgrade on the old Google Maps. The turn-by-turn is phenomenal, the activation of the locked screen and 1-tap return to directions are great... the 3D models of bigger cities (bigger than ABQ at least) are amazing.

I've depended on it heavily over the last several months as I did a rural rotation in an unfamiliar town in Northern NM as well as residency interviews all across the country. It has been a lifesaver; I can't imagine how much more difficult navigation would have been if I'd been trying to use the old Google Maps (though the new one seems pretty good). I simply don't understand the people that act like this is some catastrophe â€” it's not just good, it's great.

I _have_ had 2 instances where it didn't behave like I'd anticipated, leaving me a bit confused. In both cases, I found that the little red pin that marks the destination was in the correct location, but that the blue path (as well as the turn-by-turn directions) led somewhere nearby but not-quite-right. Here's an example:

<div id="attachment_1857" style="width: 179px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
  <a href="{{ site.url }}/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0487.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0487-169x300.png" alt="Make sure you're at the red pin!" width="169" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1857" srcset="{{ site.url }}/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0487-169x300.png 169w, http://n8henrie.com/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0487-576x1024.png 576w, http://n8henrie.com/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0487.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Make sure you're at the red pin!
  </p>
</div>

At first I was a bit worried, as I had no idea where it had led me (I was looking to return a rental car before a flight in the first instance, hence the concern and time crunch). Luckily, I noticed the discrepancy between the blue path and the red pin, and so I simply found my way to the pin, which was no more then a few hundred yards away.

Figured I'd throw this tip out there, since it's happened to me twice now: if iOS6 Maps seems to have taken you to the wrong location, double check and make sure that you're at the red pin.
