**Bottom Line:** <a target="_blank" href="https://pushover.net/">Pushover</a> is an app that specializes in getting push notifications to your iOS or Android device.

This post started as an email, but I decided that <a target="_blank" href="https://pushover.net/">Pushover</a> is cool enough to deserve a quick post. 

It&#8217;s basically an app that specialized in getting push notifications to your iOS or Android device. For iOS, it&#8217;s $4, but it&#8217;s also a &#8220;universal&#8221; app, so if you have an iPad it will also have a aesthetically pleasing display there (instead of running in 2x mode).

One of the easiest and most basic ways to use Pushover is email triggers &#8211; it gives you a special email address, and anything sent to that address will trigger a notification. As an example, I used this during interview season for medical school. I&#8217;m going into emergency medicine, and residency interviews are competitive. Some schools will have their interview slots full within hours of sending out invitations, so _time is of the essence_ when it comes to responding to an interview invitation. I had given my Gmail address to ERAS so that the interview-relevant emails were sent there, and I set up a Gmail filter to find emails matching the general pattern of the ERAS interview invitations

> from:(noreply@eraspod.aamc.org) interview

and set those up to forward to my Pushover email. This means that I got a push notification on my iPhone as soon as I got an interview invitation, and as a consequence I had little trouble responding in a very timely manner.

Note that with iOS6&#8217;s &#8220;VIP&#8221; feature, you could save yourself $4 by just setting up a contact (noreply@eraspod.aamc.org), setting them as a VIP, and then you&#8217;d get a bit more exciting notification when something came from them. On the flip side, my VIP notifications don&#8217;t seem to be making my phone vibrate… I&#8217;m not sure why that is, but without a vibration, I probably would have never noticed the notification while working in clinic.

Pushover has way more to offer than just email notifications, though. One really cool feature (actually, it&#8217;s what prompted me to purchase) is integration with <a target="_blank" href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>. If you don&#8217;t know about IFTTT… check it out, and <a target="_blank" href="https://ifttt.com/people/n8henrie">here are a few of my personal IFTTT recipes</a>, the ones I&#8217;ve made public. Using IFTTT and Pushover together, you can set up push notifications for all kinds of things (like the weather &#8211; one of my favs).

Additionally, there are a wide variety of plugins available, like its plugin for Growl and for <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/pushover-notifications/">WordPress</a>. One of the coolest features for advanced users is implementing the Pushover API to use push notifications _in your own scripts._ It&#8217;s surprisingly easy to understand, well documented, and soon you could have your local machine running scripts that notify you of events instantly, wherever you are.
