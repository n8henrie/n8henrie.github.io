**Bottom Line:** Quicksilver v1.0 has some new options for writing AppleScript actions, so I made a quick template that I thought I’d share.<!--more-->

Anyone that frequents n8henrie.com will know that [I love Quicksilver](http://n8henrie.com/tag/quicksilver). Recently, <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.qsapp.com/post/46268365849/quicksilver-comes-of-age">Quicksilver finally became a 1.0 release</a>, and with that update came some changes to its ability to use custom AppleScript actions. There is <a target="_blank" href="http://qsapp.com/wiki/AppleScript_Types">a great overview of writing custom AppleScript actions</a> at the official site, so I used it to write a template script. I’ve found custom QS actions to be fairly simple to write and incredibly useful, so I figured a template for the enhanced AppleScript support would be a reasonable thing to have around.

Here’s what I came up with so far. Enjoy, and if you have suggestions or clarifications, let me know in the comments section below.

Update: The official Quicksilver site has added several other templates in a great page you can check out <a href="http://qsapp.com/wiki/AppleScript_Action_templates" target="_blank">here</a>. —n8henrie Sun Apr 7 10:15:18 MDT 2013
