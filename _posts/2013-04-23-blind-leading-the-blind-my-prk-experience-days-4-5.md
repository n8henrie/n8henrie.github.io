**Bottom Line:** My experience getting a kind of vision correction surgery called <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy" title="Photorefractive keratectomy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">PRK</a>, part 4.<!--more-->

#### Day 4

Yesterday was a pretty good day. I actually felt comfortable enough to drive down to a nearby ( < 1 mi ) grocery store for a few things, at a time when traffic was very low. It wasn&#8217;t bad at all, I would have felt comfortable driving much farther, but I wanted to make sure to start small.

Honestly, neither my vision nor discomfort were all that different from POD3. I still had the occasional &#8220;foreign body sensation,&#8221; likely due to the contacts, which was especially prominent overnight when they would dry out. My eyes also felt dry, possibly even dryer than the day before, but I also spent a lot of time playing with my new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="Raspberry Pi | An ARM GNU/Linux box for $25. Take a byte!">Raspberry Pi</a>&#8230; meaning that I probably didn&#8217;t blink as much as I should have.

The thing that sticks out most was how much I wanted to get the darn bandage contacts out &#8212; if you&#8217;re a contact wearer, perhaps you&#8217;re familiar with the &#8220;these contacts have been in too long&#8221; feeling. Just uncomfortable, a little dry&#8230; hard to describe, but not good.

Still continuing the steroid and antibiotic drops QID, with lubricant PRN.

#### Day 5

This morning was the big day! No more bandage contacts! Although I probably would have felt fine driving to my appointment, I&#8217;d read (in a series of blog posts that is partly responsible for inspiring my own) that vision can be worse the day the contacts come out. For that reason, I asked a good buddy to give me a lift, and we shared some good conversation about our new home purchases (mine still in progress, his undergoing some renovation before residency).

My ophthalmologist was out of town, so I saw one of his partners, who was also extremely pleasant and patient with my several questions. She put in a few anesthetic drops, which helped her take out the contacts painlessly. She then tested my vision, each eye independently of course. It was weird, I felt like certain blinks &#8212; maybe 1/5 &#8212; left me with crystal-clear vision, while the rest were still fuzzy. She said I tested at 20/25 OS (left eye &#8212; think sinister, like in Spanish) and 20/20 OD (right eye, think &#8220;derecho&#8221; or &#8220;dextro,&#8221; most people are more dextrous with their right hand&#8230; and OU means &#8220;both eyes&#8221;). She said those numbers were well ahead of the normal timeline, that most people get there somewhere between days 7-12. She also put in some fluorescein, which we use i the emergency department to basically test for scratches on the eye (the fluorescein-ified scratches glow in a backlight), and said that the epithelium had healed over sufficiently, that the contacts were no longer necessary. Hurrah!

She gave me some more lubricant drops, and taught me something totally new &#8212; that the duration and intensity of steroid drops can affect the thickness of the (epithelial?) regrowth, which can be used to fine-tune the eyesight after PRK. Interesting! She instructed me to continue lubricant drops frequently, exhaust what&#8217;s left of the tobramycin (antibiotic), and continue the steroids for the month. We may choose to continue the steroids for longer depending on how I&#8217;m doing at checkup.

She also had some other good news &#8212; I&#8217;m good to go as far as exercise is concerned, no worries about sweat in the eyes, and I&#8217;m &#8220;officially&#8221; good enough to drive. Freedom!

The rest of the day was pretty uneventful, except that my eyes feel much more &#8220;fresh&#8221; and comfortable without those contacts. My right eye had some intermittent stinging in a specific spot for a few hours, not sure what that was about, but it seems to be gone now. Hopefully just continued healing of the epithelium.

My vision may be a bit improved compared to yesterday, but only slightly. I still haven&#8217;t really gone out at night, so I can&#8217;t comment with regards to &#8220;halo&#8221; and &#8220;shadowing&#8221; and other effects that some have experienced. I will say that some days &#8212; and even some hours &#8212; my left eye seems better than my right, but I&#8217;m relieved that today my right eye is clearly better. I&#8217;m right eye dominant, so I figure that I&#8217;d fare better if its vision is as sharp as possible.

I think I&#8217;m still going to wear the goofy eye goggles at night for a few days. I was initially told to wear it for the first week, and it&#8217;s not _that_ bad, so I might as well. (Note to self: being a &#8220;compliant&#8221; patient isn&#8217;t easy.)

I think that&#8217;s all for today, it&#8217;s bedtime, and I&#8217;m sleepy. I&#8217;m pleased to report that this blog post took me probably half the time (per word) to write than my first couple&#8230; because I can actually see what I&#8217;m typing. Font size is down to 18 from 24 :)
