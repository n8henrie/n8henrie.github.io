**Bottom Line:** My experience getting a kind of vision correction surgery called <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorefractive_keratectomy" title="Photorefractive keratectomy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">PRK</a>, part 7. <!--more-->

#### Weeks 3-8

I had my two month followup yesterday, so I thought a quick update was in order. After a 3 week taper, I finished my steroid eyedrops a little under 2 weeks ago. Currently my only &#8220;medication&#8221; related to the PRK is lubricant eyedrops as needed.

Currently my vision is very good. My right eye _seems_ not quite perfect, while my left is perfect. I say &#8220;seems&#8221; because both eyes are testing very well; yesterday I again tested at 20/15 OD, 20/15 OS, 20/10 OU. Additionally, I underwent a little further investigation with a refractor capable of 1/8 diopter adjustments, and both eyes tested at exactly plano. My right eye by all objective measures is seeing _perfectly_, even though it seems blurry at times to me. My ophthalmologist was unconcerned, told me it was still early in the game, and that we&#8217;d investigate further if it was not resolved at the four month mark. He&#8217;s entirely correct; much of the PRK literature uses 6 month and 1 year timepoints, so I probably still have some slight changes ahead.

My comfort level is excellent overall. I went camping for a few days and noticed that the smoke from our campfire bothered my right eye, which is not something I&#8217;d previously experienced (the same irritated feeling that my contacts had been giving it). It still stung a bit the day after we had the campfire, but resolved after that with no problems.

I may have noticed a bit of &#8220;halo&#8221; at night but it was hard to tell. It certainly doesn&#8217;t bother me; it&#8217;s no different than when I wore glasses (which were probably always a little smudged).

I do not have any problems with dry eyes. I have been using drops with decreasing frequency over the last weeks, to where I use them probably 0-2 times per day now. I have only been using them when I remember, and seldom due to any discomfort.

As a final note, I&#8217;ve been doing lots of work on my new house over the last few weeks, and it has been _wonderful_ to be glasses-free. I can hardly imagine how much of a hassle it would have been to have glasses, slick and smudged with sweat, sliding all over and falling off, covered in dust and grime&#8230; the PRK has made the process much, much easier!

Unless there are any major changes, I&#8217;ll probably update next in a couple of months at my next checkup.
