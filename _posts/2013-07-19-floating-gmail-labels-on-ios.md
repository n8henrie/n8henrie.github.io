**Bottom Line:** Prefix a label with a hashtag and a space to float it to the top of your Gmail labels in iOS while still being able to get there with Gmail&#8217;s keyboard shortcuts.<!--more-->

I&#8217;ve [waxed el&#8230; longwinded](http://n8henrie.com/2012/09/gmail-workflow-with-priority-inbox-and-ios-and-a-new-omnifocus-bookmarklet/) before about my email workflow. Basically, email goes from my inbox to one of three places.

  * **Action**: I need to do make the next move with this email. The ball is in my court.
  * **Waiting**: I can&#8217;t do anything at the moment, but there is still work to be done on my part, and I don&#8217;t want to lose track of this email until the task is finished. Often, I&#8217;m waiting for a response from someone or access to something.
  * **Archive**: Nothing to do.

Because iOS only displays the inbox, it is generally empty on my phone. If there is something there (in the inbox), I need to either complete the task &#8212; generally if it requires <= 2 minutes and/or can be reasonably completed on the phone &#8212; or I process it into one of the above labels.

This works pretty well on the iPhone, since moving messages (with the little folder-with-a-down-arrow button) both labels and archives the message, getting it out of the inbox. One problem I ran into was that I also have a ton of other labels I use on occasion, and on iOS I had to scroll through all of them to get to alphabetically-challenged &#8220;Waiting&#8221; label.

Often, you can get around this issue with alphabetized lists by adding a symbol prefix; I use **#**. However, this produced another problem. I _love_ the keyboard shortcuts with Gmail&#8217;s web interface. They dramatically speed things up for me. For example, when viewing a message, I can hit **l** (for **Label**), type in the label name, and hit return. Done, message labelled. Hit **e** to archive, and I&#8217;m off to the next email. Or when I get a response for something, I can do `l -> Action, return, l -> Waiting` to move a message from Waiting to Action.

Once I had renamed my labels #Action and #Waiting, Gmail no longer recognized them in the list of labels without the **#**, and I didn&#8217;t like having to type in the # every time.

Luckily, the solution ended up being very simple: Just add a space. As you can see below, `# Action` and `# Waiting` float to the top of the list on iOS, and they also work with Gmail&#8217;s keyboard shortcuts and label filtering.

In the end, it&#8217;s an incredibly simple solution that saves me a bit of extra scrolling a few times per day.
