**Bottom Line:** Try toggling these settings on and off if your three and four finger swipe gestures stop working on your MacBook.<!--more-->

On rare occasion, I've had my three and four finger swipe gestures stop working on my 2009 MacBook Pro. A restart generally fixes the problem, but the other day I found a solution that worked without as much disruption. If this happens to you, try toggling these two settings.
  
`System Preferences -> Trackpad -> More Gestures -> Swipe between pages, Swipe between full-screen apps`

If it doesn't work at first, try toggling them off, relaunching System Preferences, then toggling them back on.

If you still don't have any luck, go for the restart. If that doesn't work, I don't know what to tell you. Good luck!
