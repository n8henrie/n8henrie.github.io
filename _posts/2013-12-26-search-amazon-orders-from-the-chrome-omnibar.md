**Bottom Line:** Use this URL to search your Amazon orders from the Chrome Omnibar.<!--more-->

I use my Amazon Prime membership a lot. I&#8217;ve had it long enough now that some of my prior purchases are wearing out, and others I like enough to get for a friend. It&#8217;s really nice to be able to go through my purchase history and find the _exact_ item I&#8217;m looking for (because it&#8217;s the _exact one I ordered_) and order another in two to three clicks.

However, to search your old orders, you have to go through a couple of menus to get to the right search box. Luckily, I discovered that you can make a custom search in Chrome to jump right to what you need. Here&#8217;s how.

  1. First, copy the URL below to the clipboard.
  2. Right click in the Chrome Omnibar and click `Edit Search Engines...`.
  3. Scroll to the bottom.
  4. Put the keyword you&#8217;d like to use to launch the search in the `Keyword` (middle) column. I used `azorders`.
  5. Name the search whatever you want in the `Add a new search` (left) column. This is what the display will say, which can be different than the keyword.
  6. Paste the URL in the `URL with %s in place` (right) column.

Url: `https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/order-history?ie=UTF8&search=%s`

Now give it a shot. You should be able to click in the Omnibar, type your keyword, hit `tab`, then search your Amazon order history directly (likely after a login). If this is something you do frequently, you might even save a few minutes per year!
