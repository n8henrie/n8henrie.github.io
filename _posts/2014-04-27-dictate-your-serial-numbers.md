**Bottom Line:** On OSX or iOS, use dictation to &#8220;type&#8221; in long strings of numbers.<!--more-->

I hate manually typing in long strings of numbers (e.g. serial numbers, credit card numbers), since I always end up constantly looking back and forth between the number and my screen to make sure I&#8217;m getting it right.

Ends up Apple&#8217;s dictation works pretty darn well for this. Just turn on dictation and start reading the number. On OSX (at least if you use <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5449" title="Mac Basics: Dictation lets you speak text instead of typing" target="_blank">Enhanced Dictation</a>), it will initially show words instead of numbers `one two three four five`, but after an instant replace them with the numbers `12345`. It even seems to recognize letters in the mix, e.g. I just dictated `456TY892`. Works fine on iOS as well.

For better or worse, it will assume that seven or ten digit numbers are phone numbers and format then as such with hyphens.
