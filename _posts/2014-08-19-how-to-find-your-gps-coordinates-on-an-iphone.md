**Bottom Line:** Your GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) can be found in iOS&#8217;s built-in Compass app.<!--more-->

A few months ago, I had a family member get lost in the woods. He spent a cold, underprepared night alone while we searched continuously from about 4 pm until 9 or 10 the following morning, when he was finally found by the helicopter, miles away from where we thought he would be.

While we searched for him, I tried to keep track of our location using <a href="!itu" target="_blank" class="broken_link">EveryTrail</a>, so we could mark where we&#8217;d been as we searched and update our strategy accordingly. However, knowing that perhaps not everyone [loves EveryTrail like I do](http://n8henrie.com/mtb), I wanted to figure out how to find my GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) using a built-in iOS app.

Initially, I used some really silly round-about way using Maps, dropping a pin, texting my location, then opening the location pin from the text. It wasn&#8217;t until a day or so later that I discovered the coordinates font-and-center in the long-forgotten Compass app (which I haven&#8217;t really used in years).

As you can see, I have **no service** while I took that screenshot, but my GPS location is still correct. _This is a critical point to understand_: **phone calls, texts, GPS, and data use different types of connections**. I don&#8217;t think the details are particularly pertinent, it&#8217;s just critical to realize that _even when you have no signal and can&#8217;t make calls_, and _even when you have no data and can&#8217;t access the internet_ it&#8217;s fairly likely that your GPS will still be working okay. I started messing with it the iOS Compass app, and so far I haven&#8217;t found a way to copy the GPS coordinates to the clipboard. If you were lost, you could just screenshot your location and send the picture (or in my case I just used the screenshot to record my location for later), but typing your coordinates into a text message will probably be more likely to get through if your signal is poor.

If you were to get lost, my general recommendations are:

  1. Get your GPS coordinates from the Compass app.
  2. Type them into a text message and try to send it by text to a few people. 
      * Even when your signal is so poor that you can&#8217;t make a phone call, sometimes you can get a text message to get through.
  3. If it doesn&#8217;t work, try to resend it a few times.
  4. If you still don&#8217;t have any luck, **turn on Airplane mode** to save battery, and hike to the nearest little peak or closest place you think you could get a little signal*. **Don&#8217;t go far.**
  5. Every once in a while, try to resend the text again.

* Generally you _should not_ try to get yourself unlost. If you&#8217;re lost, sit down and stay put. There&#8217;s a good chance that trying to find your way out / home will get you more lost and farther from help. My only exception to this rule is trying to get service to contact help, where if there is a nearby spot that you think you can get service, it&#8217;s reasonable to try.

Well, I think I&#8217;ll end this post here. The bottom line is that an an iPhone you can get your GPS location / coordinates from Compass.app. I&#8217;m planning on a followup post in the next few days with some info on the accuracy of this location as well as a Pythonista / Launch Center Pro script to get your coordinates and text them to somebody.
