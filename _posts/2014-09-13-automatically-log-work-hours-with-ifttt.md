**Bottom Line:** IFTTT&#8217;s location channels can help you automatically track your work hours.<!--more-->

As a resident, I have to track my hours at work to make sure I&#8217;m not at the hospital longer than I&#8217;m supposed to be. Many people probably just guess-timate, but I prefer to track my actual hours as accurately as possible, because I find it interesting to go back in later and compare how much it _felt_ like I was working to the hours I actually put in.

IFTTT has simplified the process with <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifttt/id660944635?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l5H6" title="IFTTT">their iOS app</a> and its Location trigger. Whenever I enter or exit a predefined area centered at my workplace, it automatically logs a timestamp into a Google Drive spreadsheet for me. Later, when I enter my hours into the website we have to use, I just pull up that spreadsheet, enter the info, and delete the rows afterward. Alternatively, one could use the Dropbox channel to append rows to a text file, which may be even easier / faster / more accessible.

Here&#8217;s my current IFTTT recipe:
